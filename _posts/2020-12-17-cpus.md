Much has been said about how the processing power of modern CPUs and GPUs grows exponentially. 
What's often neglected is that typical software is written in a sequential fashion, where each execution step assumes the previous one has already finished. 
Running a single-threaded Python script on a 1000 core computer does not necessarily result in a significant speedup compared to a 1-core machine.
Consequently, an exciting performance metric for comparing different CPUs is how long they need to execute a given program's command sequence sequentially.
Single thread performance captures these criteria. 
Here we use [PassMark's performance scores](https://www.passmark.com/), as data for single-thread performance for an extensive collection of different CPUs is available on their website. 

The image below shows a selection of high-end desktop CPUs from Intel (in blue) and AMD (in red) over the past 15 years. On the y-axis, we have the single-thread performance according to [PassMark](https://www.passmark.com/).
The shaded curves in the background represent the regression curves for hypothetical CPUs that become 5% (in orange), 10% (in yellow), and 15% (in green) faster each year.

In this figure, we observe that the overall industry trend of the past 15 years is slightly more than 10% per year. 
However, an even more interesting observation is that this increase is not distributed uniformly, but progress happens in jumps.
For instance, Intel's Core2 Duo and Core-i 2000 series (Sandy-Bridge) brought a significant improvement compared to the older generation. A similar trend is visible with AMD's Ryzen series, which, since its introduction in 2017, first caught-up with and then even outperformed Intels top-class products.

We can hope that with the recent increase in competition in the CPU market, e.g., [Apple's M1's astonishing performance](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2), that we continue to see even higher growth in single-threaded processing power.

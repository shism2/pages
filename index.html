<h1>About me</h1>
<div style="font-size: 1.3rem;">
    I am postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
        Laboratory (CSAIL)</a> at MIT, working with <a href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/">Prof. Daniela Rus</a>.
    I completed a PhD (2022) at the <a href="https://ist.ac.at/">Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)</a>
    supervised by
    <a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/research/henzinger-group/">Tom Henzinger</a>.

    My research focuses on developing <b>robust</b> and <b>trustworthy</b> machine learning algorithms.
    The ultimate goal of my research is to improve our understanding of the decision-making process of deep neural
    networks and, accordingly, design new models with enhanced generalization and robustness. To achieve this, I pursue
    three potential paths: (1) Identify the origin of a deep network's wrong decisions and, subsequently, build
    algorithms and models that learn less error-prone representations. (2) Constructing deep models with an
    interpretable decision-making process and transparent output predictions. (3) Develop formal verification methods
    for deep networks, which provide guarantees on the models' worst-case behavior.
